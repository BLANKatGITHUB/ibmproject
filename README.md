problem satetement:to Predict mental fitness  rate of a person through various features

this project uses the survey from i found on kaggle as the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results to train the linear classifier model to pridict the mental health problems of a person as 0 or 1
0= negative while 1= positive 
it takes various features such as age , fav genre and other features  to pridict the output 
the dataset is small and without research its not certain if music can be considered as a factor for mental health this is just a project and i cant gurantee its real world performance.
I thought it was intreasting to relate music and its effect on mental health so  i madew this thus this project should not be taken as real world model.
